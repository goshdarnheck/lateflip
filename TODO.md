# using Lateflip

- pages can be added in the pages folder
- "daily" pages that show up in the archive should be put in their year and month folder and named by their day of the month, for example `/pages/2020/01/01.js` for January 1st, 2020
- note that month and day numbers are should always be left padded with 0
- to add pages to the archives add "frontmatter" export to your page file
